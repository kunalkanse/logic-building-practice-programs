This folder should hava contains .class file of the program ArrayX.java
cause i have created this folder as package for the 
Program119_Converted118_To_package.java 

imported arrayXPackage.Arrayx in this java file

to create the package for Arrax.java we have to write command as 

=> javac ArrayX.java -d .

while -d means directory & . represent current directory

that means create folder in current folder
